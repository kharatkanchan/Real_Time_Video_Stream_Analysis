Real-Time Video Stream Analysis


Overview:
This project aims to create a system for analyzing and processing real-time video streams. The system predicts the age and gender of detected faces using Java and the OpenCV library.

Features:
Object Detection: Identify and track objects within the video stream.
Facial Recognition: Detect faces and predict age and gender.
Motion Tracking: Monitor and track movement within the video stream.
Video Processing: Integration with various video sources, including cameras and video feeds.
Visualization: Frontend GUI for visualizing processed video streams and analysis results.

Requirements:
Java
OpenCV

Compile and run the project using your preferred Java IDE or command line.

Usage:
Launch the application to start analyzing video streams.
Use the provided buttons to control the video stream and toggle recognition features.
The GUI will display the video stream with annotated detections and predictions.
